I have given submission in the form of both the python(.py) files and notebook(.ipynb) files.
The notebook has to be uploaded on google colab and then you can see all the code and ouput of the code. In the notebook the SVM code is also present as I was using google colab for this assignment.

Running the python(.py) files:
Open the current folder in terminal and then run the file by typing $python3 <filename> in the terminal.

If you want to run some other dataset using these scripts then you need to give the path to the file in the variable named 'filepath' in the code. The intialisation section is mentioned in the comments in the code also. Once this initialisation is done, you can run the code by saving the file and then again following the steps given above.
